### Bio

I am working as a postdoctoral scholar at [Network Security Lab](https://labs.ece.uw.edu/nsl/faculty/radha/people.html), University of Washington. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Oregon State University (OSU) under supervision of [Prof. Rakesh B. Bobba](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/bobba-rakesh). My Ph.D. project focused on Image Privacy and intersection of Machine Learning and Cybersecurity. I collaborated with  [Prof. Wuchi Feng](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~wuchi/) and [Prof. Charles Wright](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~cvwright/) at Portland State University on my image privacy project. In this project we  exploed  the practical adversarial perturbations for my image privacy in image sharing platforms project. I also worked with 
 [Dr. Mahdieh Abbasi](http://mahdane.github.io), from Univertie' Laval in Quebec, on our dependable and secure deep neural networks project in which we tended to detect and reject adversarial and out-distribution examples. I also worked as gradurate research assistant at [Digital Media Lab](http://dml.ce.sharif.edu/dmlsite/?q=people) and conducted research on complex networks analysis methods and graph theories. I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Computer Engineeing and Computer Science at Sharif University of Technology. In general, my research areas of intrerest are:

* **Robust and Private Deep Learning** 
* **Reinforcement Learning** 
* **Natural Language Processing** 
* **Cybersecurity**
